# Terminology 

## Strongly Typed Languages demand the specification of types like ts
## Loosely Typed Languages do not require the specification of types like js


## A language that is strongly typed can be either statically or dynamically typed
 ###  typescript is a statically typed language. this means types are checked at compile time
 ### javascript is a dynamically typed language. this means types are checked at run time

 # Benefits for typed languages:
 1. Self-documenting
 2. Catch errors during development 
 3. Great for teams
